# clima_oop2_w2 Week 2

Flutter Weather project.

## Getting Started 26 Feb 2023

A few tasks that we'll do today, after we use api key to get the Data:

1- Get Weather Data for our specified location using Long and Lat values after click on the Button in the Loading Screen.
2- Get Weather Data and position info (Lat & Long) automatically without using the Button on the Loading Screen by using initState.
3- Send Weather Data to the City Screen to be used in updating the Screen.
4- Show loading indicator in the LoadingScreen to tell user there is loading process.
